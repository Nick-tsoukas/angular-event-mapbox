So far the event bar is populated with raw json from the api.
Markers for the map are created dynamically from the express api
The map zooms in to the latest event that happened

The event bar list item should call a function that can fly to the coordinates of the event;

Also clicking on that should open up a popup for the event marker

Maybe should open the popup on start
